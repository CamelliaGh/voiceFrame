# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize the project repository with the necessary structure and tools for development.
# Details:
The project repository has been successfully set up with a Git repository initialized and a comprehensive .gitignore. The frontend is structured using React/TypeScript with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Vitest for testing. The backend is structured with Python/FastAPI, including Alembic for migrations and a comprehensive service layer. Docker configuration is included with docker-compose.yml and Dockerfiles. The database setup includes models, schemas, and migrations. Testing infrastructure is established for both frontend and backend. Documentation structure includes multiple guides. Package management is handled with npm for frontend and pip for backend. The project structure also includes templates, fonts, backgrounds, and a comprehensive service layer.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the repository is fully functional and ready for development. Ensure that all necessary files and folders are present, and that the project can be cloned and set up without errors. Test the Docker setup, database migrations, and both frontend and backend testing infrastructure.
